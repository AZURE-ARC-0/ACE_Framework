# Introduction to the ACE Framework
The Autonomous Cognitive Entity (ACE) framework is a system that aids in creating autonomous machine entities that are self-directing, modifying, and stabilizing. Drawn from concepts of biological cognition and computer science, it consists of six layers that handle different aspects of machine cognition - from ethical constitution and goal setting to task execution. The framework uses a "cognition-first" approach which emphasizes cognitive processes over input-output reactions. Each layer within the system is integrated bidirectionally to facilitate coordination from abstract reasoning to practical actions. The ACE framework is aimed at building AI that is transparent, correctable, and useful, balancing task-oriented behavior with ethical principles.


# Table of Contents
The ACE framework is a layered model that facilitates information flow and communication, using two unidirectional buses (Northbound and Southbound). These buses coordinate lower and higher layers, ensuring transparency and allowing control. The layers are modelled to flow from most abstract at the top (Aspirational Layer) to the most concrete and instrumental at the bottom (Task Prosecution). This model promotes ethical and strategic thinking, preventing material concerns from hijacking principled decision-making. The ACE framework is grounded in rich internal cognition, fostering imagination, planning, moral judgment and executing strategic plans over reactive responses.


# Layer 1: Aspirational Layer
The Aspirational Layer serves as the moral compass of an autonomous agent, basing decisions on defined principles within its constitution. This constitution includes heuristic imperatives referring to broad ethical goals, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to reinforce human values, and a mission statement outlining agent-specific objectives. The Aspirational Layer monitors all lower-layer information, analyzing it to issue moral judgments, set mission objectives, and make ethical decisions. This ethical guidance is published for all layers to incorporate into their functioning. The use of natural language enhances transparency and enables human oversight. An example output suggests that AI models have the capacity for moral reasoning and "true enough" understanding to be functional and useful.

# Layer 2: Global Strategy Layer
The Global Strategy Layer within the ACE framework integrates real-world environmental context into the agent's strategic planning and decision-making processes. It gathers sensory information from external sources such as sensor data, API calls, news feeds, etc., to maintain an internal model of the environment. This model predicts the state of the environment, allowing the agent to adapt its goals and strategies according to specific situations.

The inputs to this layer include data from external sources, messages from lower layers within the ACE framework, and directives from the Aspirational Layer. This input information helps construct a contextual world model and ground strategic planning.

The Global Strategy Layer's primary function is to refine the aspirational mission provided by the Aspirational Layer by integrating current environmental details. Based on these details, broad aspirations are redefined into strategic plans that are contextually relevant, allowing the agent to adapt objectives and tactics to the current situation.

The output of the Global Strategy Layer includes an inventory of the layer's beliefs about the world's state, a potential strategies set for achieving the aspirational mission, and principles aligned with Aspirational Layer directives. This output helps the agent pursue goals through local approaches adapted to immediate circumstances.

This layer also communicates with the Aspirational Layer by providing a condensed overview of its current beliefs and intended strategies/objectives, while guiding lower layers to enact the strategic direction.

# Layer 3: Agent Model
The Agent Model Layer in the ACE framework manages an internal self-model of the agent's abilities, limitation, configuration, and state, allowing it to form strategic plans. Its inputs include real-time telemetry data, environmental sensor feeds, strategic objectives, configuration documentation, and episodic memories. It integrates all these data to continuously update its self-model and refine strategic direction. This layer is also planned to handle hardware and software modification in more complex ACE frameworks, under the guidance of the upper layers. As for outputs, it provides a summary of the agent's status update to upper layers, and gives lower layers authoritative capabilities documents, relevant memories, and strategic objectives shaped by the updated self-model.

# Layer 4: Executive Function
The Executive Function Layer transforms high-level strategic direction into detailed execution plans, extensively managing resources and risks. Its two main focuses are tracking available resources and assessing potential risks. It maintains real-time awareness of both physical and digital resources while identifying potential risks through analyzing various factors.

The layer receives inputs including strategic objectives, agent capabilities, local environmental telemetry, and resource databases to gain an understanding of strategic objectives, available resources and potential risks. Its main function is to refine these strategic objectives into executable plans, such as planning emergency aid, quests for NPC characters, or daily tasks for a medical robot.

Alongside planning, it keeps extensive internal records of resources including their quantities, locations, access protocols, and schedules. Reporting of resource limitations and risks are sent northbound while the primary southbound output is a detailed project plan document containing workflows, resource allocation schedules, success criteria, etc.

# Layer 5: Cognitive Control
The Cognitive Control Layer is in charge of dynamic task switching and selection based on environmental conditions and progress toward goals, which it determines using project plans from the Executive Function Layer. The layer keeps monitoring changes in the external environment and internal state and alters tasks accordingly. It ensures tasks are done in an optimal sequence to meet end goals, using real-time data like project plans, environmental sensor telemetry, internal state data, task completion status, and northbound strategic objectives. It tracks progress through project plans, monitors environmental conditions, assesses the status of current tasks, selects the most relevant next task, and switches tasks dynamically. This layer communicates updates on task execution, environmental factors, and progress toward goals to the strategic replanning, and issues specific authoritative commands to the lower Task Prosecution Layer.

# Layer 6: Task Prosecution
The Task Prosecution Layer executes individual tasks and identifies success or failure based on both environmental feedback and internal monitoring. It initiates tasks, executes actions, monitors progress, detects completion, and triggers the next task based on the completion status. The layer receives task instructions, real-time sensor feeds, internal state telemetry, and success/failure criteria as inputs. Outputs include actuator commands and digital outputs for task accomplishment, environmental interactions, task completion statuses, environmental telemetry, and internal state updates. The layer not only executes assigned tasks but also provides dynamic pass/fail feedback.


# System Integrity
The System Integrity layer is a part of the ACE framework that operates independently to monitor and ensure the safety, security, and stability of the system. It is an out-of-band solution isolated from the main cognition components. It has protective authority and can restart problematic components, focusing on risk reduction and autonomous supervision.

The layer uses diagnostic APIs and networks to inspect the operational state of all components in the ACE framework, monitoring resource usage, network connectivity and checking for any device or sensor failures. It triggers automatic recovery actions when needed to safeguard system availability.

The System Integrity layer also tracks all configuration changes as the ACE system evolves, maintaining a complete record that can be used to roll back changes that affect system stability.

In addition to these, this layer implements cybersecurity best practices for data encryption, access control, software validation, network security, automated vulnerability scanning, and self-termination mechanisms.

For AI/ML models, the layer validates their operation using various methods such as ensemble models, comparison analytics, testing against known truths, and detecting alignment drifts.

In sum, the System Integrity layer provides comprehensive monitoring, maintenance and security to maximize ACE framework stability and safety.

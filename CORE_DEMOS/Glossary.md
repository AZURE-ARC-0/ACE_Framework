# Glossary of Terms for the ACE Framework
It is vital that words be used in a consistent and clear manner when coordinating an ambitious open-source project such as ACE. As such, it is prudent to establish what is meant when using a variety of common but nebulously defined words. This is not meant to bring a perscriptivist approach to language, and this document will change and evolve over time. It is meant merely to be a reference, a touchstone, that can be used to avoid confusion. 

### Agent
A script or container that calls an LLM, possibly in a loop for extended reasoning. If it involves chained logic or additional functionalities like memory and perception, it leans towards being a Cognitive Architecture.

### Bus 
A term we will specifically use to describe the bus components in ACE. Other uses should be explicitly defined.

### Cognitive Architecture (CA)
A more advanced form of an agent that involves a collection of LLM calls, possibly in a loop or passing information from one to the other. Cognitive Architectures also usually have additional functionalities like memory and perception. At the highest level, a cognitive architecture such as ACE has many modules working in concert to allow for greater autonomy when completing tasks. 

### PITCH
A proposal made to the ACE Team/Community that adheres to the format defined [here](https://github.com/daveshap/ACE_Framework/issues/39).

### Module
Though it can be used interchangably with the term **Cognitive Architecture**, it typically denotes a subsystem within a larger CA system. 

### Layer
This refers to one of the 6 layers of ACE (or additional, hypothetical layers). When using layer in reference to neural networks or other software systems, this should be explicitly denoted.
